# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
  - According to our results, vehicle length and ground clearance (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance       to the linear model. In other words the vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on the car's mpg.
  - The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. The p-value, 5.35e-11, is much smaller than the normal significance level of 0.05 which         means there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
  - This linear model does effectively predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. The R-squared value of 0.71 indicates that 71% of the observed                   variation in mpg can be explained by the independent variables in this model.
